-----------
Handles the "Dynamic Database" requirement of the brief.

Why SQLite, and why this schema is "dynamic":
- TOTAL_SLOTS is a config value, not hard-coded row-by-row logic. Increasing
  it (e.g. the client adds a new parking level) only means changing one
  number and re-running init_db() - it will INSERT the extra slot rows
  without touching existing data (see ensure_slot_count()).
- The `sessions` table is an append-only log: every arrival creates a new
  row, every departure updates that same row (exit_time, fee, status).
  So the database grows dynamically with real traffic instead of using a
  fixed-size structure - this is what lets us produce history / reports.
- Foreign key (slot_id) ties a session to a physical slot so we can always
  answer "which car is in slot 7 right now?" with a single indexed query.
